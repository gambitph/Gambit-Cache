All the perks of caching plus more.. pain-free

== Description ==

Gambit Cache is a caching plugin designed to speed up the performance of your website, all while being easy to set up.

The goal of Gambit Cache is to educate you on what the different caching techniques are. This is so that you know exactly what is happening to your website.

Gambit Cache aims to be easily used by everyone, from the beginner who just wants a faster responding blog in their shared hosting, to the advanced user who wants to squeeze every millisecond out from their page loading times.
